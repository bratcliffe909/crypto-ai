# Mobile Wallet Redesign - Cleaner, More Cohesive Color Scheme

## Overview

The mobile wallet has been redesigned with a cleaner, more cohesive color scheme that follows modern financial app design principles. The new design reduces color usage while maintaining visual hierarchy and improving user experience.

## Key Design Improvements

### 1. **Limited Color Palette**
The redesign uses a restricted color palette following the "three color rule":
- **Primary Blue**: `#0066ff` (light) / `#4d94ff` (dark) - Trust and professionalism
- **Semantic Colors**: Green for gains (`#00c853`), Red for losses (`#ff3b30`)
- **Neutral Grays**: For backgrounds, borders, and secondary text

### 2. **Improved Visual Hierarchy**
- **Clear separation** between header, content, and footer sections
- **Card-based design** for individual coins with subtle shadows
- **Better contrast ratios** for improved readability
- **Consistent spacing** throughout the interface

### 3. **Enhanced User Experience**
- **Subtle animations** on interactions (hover, active states)
- **Improved touch targets** for mobile devices
- **Better focus states** for accessibility
- **Cleaner currency selector** with pill-shaped design

### 4. **Dark Mode Optimization**
- Carefully selected colors that work well in both light and dark themes
- Proper contrast ratios maintained across themes
- Subtle adjustments to shadows and borders for dark mode

## Color Usage Comparison

### Before (Original Design)
- Multiple shades of blue from Bootstrap variables
- Various gray values without clear hierarchy
- Inconsistent use of success/danger colors
- Mixed border and background colors

### After (Redesigned)
- **Primary Actions**: Single blue (`#0066ff`)
- **Positive Values**: Consistent green (`#00c853`)
- **Negative Values**: Consistent red (`#ff3b30`)
- **Backgrounds**: Two-level hierarchy (surface/background)
- **Text**: Three levels (primary/secondary/tertiary)

## Implementation Details

### CSS Variables
The redesign uses CSS custom properties for easy theming:
```css
:root {
  --wallet-primary: #0066ff;
  --wallet-success: #00c853;
  --wallet-danger: #ff3b30;
  --wallet-bg: #ffffff;
  --wallet-surface: #f8f9fa;
  /* ... etc */
}
```

### Component Structure
The component structure remains largely the same with minor adjustments:
- Removed unnecessary wrapper divs
- Simplified class names
- Improved semantic HTML structure

### Key Visual Changes

   - Cleaner background with subtle shadow
   - Better spacing and alignment
   - Improved time display styling

2. **Portfolio Summary**

   - Redesigned currency selector with active state

3. **Coin Cards**

## Usage Instructions

   ```
